Airline tickets will be awarded in the form of a Hawaiian Airlines voucher.  Winner has ninety (90) days to activate the voucher and has eighteen (18) months from voucher activation date to redeem the miles.  Travel must be made through Sponsor's agent. Once the travel schedule has been arranged, it cannot be altered and failure of winner to follow such schedule shall not obligate Sponsor in any way to provide the winner with alternate arrangements. Released Parties are not responsible for airline cancellations or delays. Sponsor, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to provide ground transportation in place of air transportation if winner lives within a 100 mile radius of Oahu, Hawaii, as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion, and to award no additional compensation or substitution for the difference in prize value in such event. Winner and his/her respective guest must travel together on the same itinerary and are responsible for obtaining any/all necessary travel documents (including but not limited to valid photo I.D.) prior to departure. If the actual value of the prize is less than the stated ARV, the difference will not be awarded. Winner may be required to provide a credit card at time of hotel check-in to cover hotel incidentals. Any depiction of prize is for illustrative purposes only. Prize elements may not be separated.
